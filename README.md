# TEM_analyzer
Tool for TEM image analysis

Atomic position and amplitude are analyzed by fitting with the Gaussian functions.

The above figure shows the experimental TEM image (the upper right panel), simulated TEM image (the upper left panel), and the experimental TEM image superimposed by the position markers (the lower panel). The siimulated image and position markers was generated by this program. Exact atmoc positions and amplitude will be quntifed by adjusting the fitting parameters minimzing reduced mean square error between the experiment and simulation. Positions and amplitudes for all atoms will be obtained. You will input atom types to be anlayzed, and the information will be used to separated obtained fitting parameters into the separated data with respect to the atom types.

Preprocess of image like image rotation, clipping, and signal filtering can be conducted also.

It is useful for quantifying a slight distortion or symmetry breaking in lattice structures as well as for determining lattice information like lattice parameters or Wicyoff positions. 


numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, ipywidgets, and hyperspy.api modules are required.
